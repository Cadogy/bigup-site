						<h3>2. Skedda Services</h3>
						<p>
							2.1. Services Overview. Skedda’s Service is a software-as-a-service solution offered to subscribing Venues through a single platform. The Services are designed to enable Venue to manage bookings with Users through the entire lifecycle of their relationship with Venue and to provide a Dashboard for accessing and managing booking information and Venue Data regarding those Users. Management of bookings may be done in large part in a self-service manner directly by Users through the Services. Venue may export Venue Data between the Services and certain Third-Party Platforms through supported integrations.
						</p>	
						<p>
							2.2. Provision of Services. Each Service is provided on a renewing subscription basis until termination with respect to Section 7.1. The initial subscription is a zero-cost subscription effective from the Effective Date. If Venue does not choose to enable paid Service features after Effective Date, Skedda will provide the zero-cost Services at no charge to Venue in an ongoing manner, until termination, on the basis of a repeating term of one month ("Subscription Term"). If Venue chooses to enable paid Service features after Effective Date, this is provided on a subscription basis for a Subscription Term designated on the Order Form. In this case, Venue will purchase and Skedda will provide both the zero-cost Services as well as the specific paid Services as specified in the applicable Order Form.
						</p>
						<p>
							2.3. Access to Services. Venue may access and use the Services solely for its own benefit and in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Documentation and any scope of use restrictions designated in the applicable Order Form. Use of and access to the Services is permitted for Users. If Venue is given API keys or passwords to access the Services on Skedda’s systems, Venue will require that all Administrators keep API keys, user ID and password information strictly confidential and not share such information with any unauthorized person. User IDs are granted to individual, named persons and may not be shared. If Users are accessing the Services using credentials provided by a third party (e.g., Google), then Users will comply with all applicable terms and conditions of such third party regarding provisioning and use of such credentials. Venue will be responsible for any and all actions taken using Venue’s API keys, accounts and passwords. If any Administrator who has access to a user ID is no longer an employee (or Contractor, as set forth below) of Venue, then Venue will immediately delete such user ID and otherwise terminate such Administrator’s access to the Service.
						</p>
						<p>
							2.4. Skedda Apps. To the extent Skedda provides Skedda Apps for use with the Services, subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Skedda grants to Venue a limited, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive license during any applicable Subscription Term to use the object code form of the Skedda Apps internally, but only in connection with Venue’s use of the Service and otherwise in accordance with the Documentation and this Agreement.
						</p>
						<p>
							2.5. Deployment of Skedda Code. Subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Skedda grants to Venue a limited, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive license during any applicable Subscription Term to copy the Skedda Code in the form provided by Skedda on Venue Website solely to support Venue’s use of the Service and otherwise in accordance with the Documentation and this Agreement. Venue may implement Skedda Code on the Venue Website in order to enable embedding of the Skedda Service on the Venue Website, and in such cases will implement all Skedda Code in strict accordance with the Documentation and other instructions provided by Skedda. Venue acknowledges that any changes made to the Venue Website after initial implementation of Skedda Code may cause the Services to cease working or function improperly and that Skedda will have no responsibility for the impact of any such Venue changes.
						</p>
						<p>
							2.6. Contractors and Affiliates. Venue may permit its Contractors and its Affiliates' employees and Contractors to serve as Administrators, provided Venue remains responsible for compliance by such individuals with all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and any use of the Services by such individuals is for the sole benefit of Venue.
						</p>
						<p>
							2.7. General Restrictions. Venue will not (and will not permit any third party to): (a) rent, lease, provide access to or sublicense the Services to a third party; (b) use the Services to provide, or incorporate the Services into, any product or service provided to a third party; (c) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise seek to obtain the source code or non-public APIs to the Services, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law (and then only upon advance notice to Skedda); (d) copy or modify the Services or any Documentation, or create any derivative work from any of the foregoing; (e) remove or obscure any proprietary or other notices contained in the Services (including without limitation (i) the "Powered by Skedda" designation that may appear as part of the deployment of the Services on Venue Website and (ii) notices on any reports or data printed from the Services); or (f) publicly disseminate information regarding the performance of the Services.
						</p>
						<p>
							2.8. Skedda APIs. If Skedda makes access to any APIs available as part of the Services, Skedda reserves the right to place limits on access to such APIs (e.g., limits on numbers of calls or requests). Further, Skedda may monitor Venue’s usage of such APIs and limit the number of calls or requests Venue may make if Skedda believes that Venue’s usage is in breach of this Agreement or may negatively affect the Services (or otherwise impose liability on Skedda).
						</p>
						<p>
							2.9. Trial Subscriptions. If Venue receives free access or a trial or evaluation subscription to paid features of the Service (a "Trial Subscription"), then Venue may use the relevant paid features of the Services in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement for a period of thirty (30) days or such other period granted by Skedda (the "Trial Period"). Trial Subscriptions are permitted solely for Venue’s use to determine whether to purchase a paid subscription to the Services. Trial Subscriptions may not include all functionality and features accessible as part of a paid Subscription Term. If Venue does not enter into a paid Subscription Term, Venue’s access and use the Services will be suspended (no new bookings possible) at the end of the Trial Period until the Venue disables any paid features and hence returns to zero-cost subscription limits. Skedda has the right to terminate a Trial Subscription at any time for any reason. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT, SKEDDA WILL HAVE NO WARRANTY, INDEMNITY, SUPPORT, OR OTHER OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO TRIAL SUBSCRIPTIONS.
						</p>
						<h3>3. Venue Data</h3>
						<p>
							3.1. Rights in Venue Data. As between the parties, Venue will retain all right, title and interest (including any and all intellectual property rights) in and to the Venue Data as provided to Skedda. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Venue hereby grants to Skedda a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free right to use, copy, store, transmit, modify, create derivative works of and display the Venue Data solely to the extent necessary to provide the Services to Venue. 
						</p>
						<p>
							3.2. Storage of Venue Data. Skedda will store Venue Data and make such data available through the Services on behalf of Venue in accordance with Privacy Policy. Skedda agrees only that it will not intentionally delete any Venue Data from any Service prior to termination of Venue’s applicable Subscription Term, with the following exceptions: 
							Old booking data is periodically deleted as per the booking data-retention period setting as configured by the Venue in the Venue Account (as described in the Documentation).
							Booking audit logs ("bookings feed") are deleted after ninety (90) days.
						</p>
						<p>
							3.3. Venue Obligations.
						</p>
						<p style="margin-left: 10%">
							a) In General. Venue is solely responsible for the accuracy, content and legality of all Venue Data. Venue represents and warrants to Skedda that Venue has all necessary rights, consents and permissions to collect, share and use all Venue Data as contemplated in this Agreement (including granting Skedda the rights in Section 3.1 (Rights in Venue Data)) and that no Venue Data will violate or infringe (i) any third party intellectual property, publicity, privacy or other rights, (ii) any Laws, or (iii) any terms of service, privacy policies or other agreements governing the Venue Website or Venue’s accounts with any Third-Party Platforms. If Venue submits Venue Data to the Services on behalf of any User, unambiguous consent of that User must be presentable to Skedda and any relevant supervising authorities on request if required by law. Venue will be fully responsible for any Venue Data submitted to the Services by any User as if it was submitted by Venue.
						</p>
						<p style="margin-left: 10%">
							b) No Sensitive Personal Information. Venue specifically agrees not to use the Services to collect, store, process or transmit any Sensitive Personal Information. Venue acknowledges that Skedda is not a Business Associate or subcontractor as those terms are defined in HIPAA and that the Services are not HIPAA compliant. The collection of payment-card information is permitted within the dedicated and Stripe-hosted (via iframe technology) form controls for payment-card entry as described in Documentation (for booking payment and subscription payment). Venue acknowledges that Skedda is not a payment-card processor of raw payment-card information and that the Services are not PCI DSS compliant if Venue enters raw payment-card information into the services using other means. Skedda will have no liability under this Agreement for Sensitive Personal Information, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein.
						</p>
						<p style="margin-left: 10%">
							c) Compliance with Laws. Venue agrees to comply with all applicable Laws in its use of the Services. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Venue will not engage in any unsolicited advertising, marketing, or other activities using the Services, including without limitation any activities that violate the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 or any other anti-spam laws and regulations.
						</p>
						<p style="margin-left: 10%">
							d) Disclosures on Venue Website. Venue acknowledges that the Skedda Code causes the Services to be accessible to each User who accesses the Venue Website. Venue will include on each Venue Website a link to its privacy policy that discloses Venue’s use of third party services to collect data about Users as described in this Agreement. Venue’s privacy policy must disclose how, and for what purposes, the data collected through Skedda Code will be used or shared with Skedda as part of the Services. Venue must also provide Users with clear and comprehensive information about the storing and accessing of cookies or other information on the Users’ devices where such activity occurs in connection with the Services and as required by applicable Laws. For clarity, as between Venue and Skedda, Venue will be solely responsible for obtaining the necessary clearances, consents and approvals from Users under all applicable Laws. 
						</p>
						<p>
							3.4. Indemnification by Venue. Venue will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Skedda from and against any and all claims, costs, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs) arising out of or in connection with any claim arising from or relating to any Venue Data or breach or alleged breach by Venue of Section 3.3 (Venue Obligations). This indemnification obligation is subject to Venue receiving (i) prompt written notice of such claim (but in any event notice in sufficient time for Venue to respond without prejudice); (ii) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defense, or settlement of such claim; and (iii) all necessary cooperation of Skedda at Venue’s expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, (a) Skedda may participate in the defense of any claim by counsel of its own choosing, at its cost and expense and (b) Venue will not settle any claim without Skedda’s prior written consent, unless the settlement fully and unconditionally releases Skedda and does not require Skedda to pay any amount, take any action, or admit any liability.
						</p>
						<p>
							3.5. Aggregated Anonymous Data. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Venue agrees that Skedda may obtain and aggregate technical and other data about Venue’s use of the Services that is non-personally identifiable with respect to Users ("Aggregated Anonymous Data"), and Skedda may use the Aggregated Anonymous Data to analyze, improve, support and operate the Services and otherwise for any business purpose during and after the term of this Agreement, including without limitation to generate industry benchmark or best practice guidance, recommendations or similar reports for distribution to and consumption by Venue and other Skedda customers. For clarity, this Section 3.5 does not give Skedda the right to identify Venue as the source of any Aggregated Anonymous Data.
						</p>
						<h3>4. Security</h3>
						<p>
							Skedda agrees to use commercially reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to prevent unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure of any Service or Venue Data. Current details on these measures can be found in the Documentation on security. However, Skedda will have no responsibility for errors in transmission, unauthorized third-party access or other causes beyond Skedda’s control.
						</p>
						<h3>5. Third-Party Platforms</h3>
						<p>
							The Services may support integrations with certain Third-Party Platforms. In order for the Services to communicate with such Third-Party Platforms, Venue may be required to input credentials in order for the Services to access and receive relevant information from such Third-Party Platforms. By enabling use of the Services with any Third-Party Platform, Venue authorizes Skedda to access Venue’s accounts with such Third-Party Platform for the purposes described in this Agreement. Venue is solely responsible for complying with any relevant terms and conditions of the Third-Party Platforms and maintaining appropriate accounts in good standing with the providers of the Third-Party Platforms. Venue acknowledges and agrees that Skedda has no responsibility or liability for any Third-Party Platform or any Venue Data exported to a Third-Party Platform. Skedda does not guarantee that the Services will maintain integrations with any Third-Party Platform and Skedda may disable integrations of the Services with any Third-Party Platform at any time with or without notice to Venue. For clarity, this Agreement governs Venue’s use of and access to the Services, even if accessed through an integration with a Third-Party Platform.
						</p>
						<h3>6. Ownership</h3>
						<p>
							6.1. Skedda Technology. This is a subscription agreement for access to and use of the Services. Venue acknowledges that it is obtaining only a limited right to the Services and that irrespective of any use of the words "purchase", "sale" or like terms in this Agreement no ownership rights are being conveyed to Venue under this Agreement. Venue agrees that Skedda or its suppliers retain all right, title and interest (including all patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property rights) in and to the Services and all Documentation, professional services deliverables and any and all related and underlying technology and documentation and any derivative works, modifications or improvements of any of the foregoing, including as may incorporate Feedback (collectively, "Skedda Technology"). Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, no rights in any Skedda Technology are granted to Venue. Further, Venue acknowledges that the Services are offered as an on-line, hosted solution, and that Venue has no right to obtain a copy of any of the Services, except for Skedda Code and the Skedda Apps in the format provided by Skedda.
						</p>
						<p>
							6.2. Feedback. Venue, from time to time, may and is encouraged to submit Feedback to Skedda. Skedda may freely use Feedback in connection with any of its products or services.
						</p>
						<h3>7. Subscription Term, Fees & Payment</h3>
						<p>
							7.1. Subscription Term and Renewals. At the Effective Date, the Venue automatically begins Service access with a zero-cost subscription and with a recurring Subscription Term of one month. If Venue enables paid features after Effective Date, Venue can choose through Order Form a recurring Subscription Term of one month or one year. Each Subscription Term, paid or unpaid, will automatically renew for an additional Subscription Term interval until the termination date (“Termination Date”) is reached. The Termination Date is either (i) the date on which Venue explicitly chooses to delete the Venue Account, or (ii) in the event that Skedda is unable to provide the Services in an ongoing manner, the future date that Skedda gives Venue written notice of at least least twenty (20) days in advance. At all times, Venue can view subscription status information in the “Your Skedda Plan” page of the Venue Account settings.
						</p>
						<p>
							7.2. Fees and Payment. If Venue decides to enable paid features, all fees are as set forth in the applicable Order Form and will be paid by Venue via Credit Card (as defined below). Except as expressly set forth in Section 9 (Limited Warranty), all fees are non-refundable. All subscription charges are in United States Dollars (USD). Venue is responsible for any currency-exchange fees that may be incurred by Venue when paying fees.
						</p>
						<p>
							7.3. Payment Via Credit Card. By purchasing the Services via credit card, debit card or other payment card ("Credit Card"), the following terms apply:
						</p>
						<p>
							Recurring Billing Authorization. By providing Credit Card information and agreeing to purchase any Services, Venue hereby authorizes Skedda (or its designee) to automatically charge Venue’s Credit Card on the same day of every month for month-interval Subscription Terms (or the closest prior date, if there are fewer days in a particular month), or on the same day of every year for year-interval Subscription Terms (or the closest prior date, if there are fewer days in a particular month on a particular year). Venue hereby authorizes Skedda (or its designee) to automatically charge all fees accrued as of that date (if any) in accordance with the applicable Order Form. Venue acknowledges and agrees that the amount billed and charged each month may vary depending on Venue’s use of the Services, particularly if the Venue activates or deactivates additional paid features. If the venue modifies its use of paid features during a Subscription Term, any pricing adjustments are prorated to the next invoice date. The price of the upcoming Venue subscription invoice can viewed at all times in the Your Skedda Plan page of the Dashboard settings area. Venue is invited to contact Skedda if they have any questions about billing proration.
						</p>
						<p>
							Foreign Transaction Fees. Venue acknowledges that for certain Credit Cards, the issuer of Venue’s Credit Card may charge a foreign transaction fee or other charges.
						</p>
						<p>
							Invalid Payment. If a payment is not successfully settled due to expiration of a Credit Card, insufficient funds, or otherwise, Venue remains responsible for any amounts not remitted to Skedda and Skedda may, in its sole discretion, either (i) invoice Venue directly for the deficient amount, (ii) continue billing the Credit Card once it has been updated by Venue (if applicable) or (iii) terminate this Agreement.
						</p>
						<p>
							Changing Credit Card Information. At any time, Venue may change its Credit Card information by entering updated Credit Card information via the "Your Skedda Plan" page on the Dashboard settings area.
						</p>
						<p>
							Termination of Recurring Billing. In addition to any termination rights set forth in this Agreement, Venue may terminate the Subscription Term at any time by sending an email to info@skedda.com with this request, with termination effective at the end of the current Subscription Term. As set forth in Section 2.9 (Trial Subscriptions), if Venue has enabled paid features but does not enter into a paid Subscription Term following a Trial Period, Venue’s access and use of the Services will be suspended (no new bookings possible) until Venue disables all paid features. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Payment of Outstanding Fees. Upon any termination or expiration of the Subscription Term, Skedda will charge Venue’s Credit Card (or invoice Venue directly) for any outstanding fees for Venue’s use of the Services during the Subscription Term, after which Skedda will not charge Venue’s Credit Card for any additional fees.
						</p>
						<p>
							7.4. Suspension of Service. If Venue’s paid subscription is three (3) days or more overdue, in addition to any of its other rights or remedies (including but not limited to any termination rights set forth herein), Skedda reserves the right to suspend Venue’s access to the applicable Service (no new bookings possible on Venue Account) without liability to Venue until such amounts are paid in full.
						</p>
						<h3>8. Term and Termination</h3>
						<p>
							8.1. Term. This Agreement is effective as of the Effective Date and expires on the Termination Date as defined in Section 7.1.
						</p>
						<p>
							8.2. Termination for Cause. Either party may terminate this Agreement (including all related Order Forms) if the other party (a) fails to cure any material breach of this Agreement (including a failure to pay fees) within thirty (30) days after written notice; (b) ceases operation without a successor; or (c) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors' arrangement, composition, or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against that party (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter).
						</p>
						<p>
							8.3. Effect of Termination. Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement, Venue will immediately cease any and all use of and access to all Services (including any and all related Skedda Technology) and delete (or, at Skedda’s request, return) any and all copies of the Documentation, any Skedda passwords or access codes and any other Skedda Confidential Information in its possession. Provided this Agreement was not terminated for Venue’s breach, Venue may retain and use internally copies of all reports exported from any Service prior to termination. Venue acknowledges that following termination it will have no further access to any Venue Data input into any Service, and that Skedda may delete any such data as may have been stored by Skedda at any time. Except where an exclusive remedy is specified, the exercise of either party of any remedy under this Agreement, including termination, will be without prejudice to any other remedies it may have under this Agreement, by law or otherwise.
						</p>
						<p>
							8.4. Survival. The following Sections will survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement: 2.7 (General Restrictions), 2.9 (Trial Subscriptions), 3.2 (Storage of Venue Data), 3.4 (Indemnification by Venue), 3.5 (Aggregated Anonymous Data), 6 (Ownership), 7.2 (Fees and Payment), 7.3 (Payment Via Credit Card), 8 (Term and Termination), 9.2 (Warranty Disclaimer), 12 (Limitation of Remedies and Damages), 13 (Confidential Information) and 14 (General Terms).
						</p>
						<h3>9. Limited Warranty</h3>
						<p>
							9.1. Limited Warranty. Skedda warrants, for Venue’s benefit only, that each Service will operate in substantial conformity with the applicable Documentation. Skedda’s sole liability (and Venue’s sole and exclusive remedy) for any breach of this warranty will be, at no charge to Venue, for Skedda to use commercially reasonable efforts to correct the reported non-conformity, or if Skedda determines such remedy to be impracticable, either party may terminate the applicable Subscription Term and Venue will receive as its sole remedy a refund of any fees Venue has pre-paid for use of such Service for the terminated portion of the applicable Subscription Term. The limited warranty set forth in this Section 9.1 will not apply: (i) unless Venue makes a claim within thirty (30) days of the date on which Venue first noticed the non-conformity, (ii) if the error was caused by misuse, unauthorized modifications or third-party hardware, software or services, or (iii) to use provided on a no-charge, trial or evaluation basis.
						</p>
						<p>
							9.2. Warranty Disclaimer. EXCEPT FOR THE LIMITED WARRANTY IN SECTION 9.1, ALL Services ARE PROVIDED "AS IS". NEITHER SKEDDA NOR ITS SUPPLIERS MAKES ANY OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NONINFRINGEMENT. Skedda DOES NOT WARRANT THAT Venue’s USE OF THE Services WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, NOR DOES Skedda WARRANT THAT IT WILL REVIEW THE Venue Data FOR ACCURACY OR THAT IT WILL PRESERVE OR MAINTAIN THE Venue Data WITHOUT LOSS OR CORRUPTION. SKEDDA SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR THE RESULTS OF ANY COMMUNICATIONS SENT OR ANY COMMUNICATIONS THAT WERE FAILED TO BE SENT USING THE SERVICES. Skedda SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR DELAYS, INTERRUPTIONS, SERVICE FAILURES OR OTHER PROBLEMS INHERENT IN USE OF THE INTERNET AND ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS, THIRD-PARTY PLATFORMS OR OTHER SYSTEMS OUTSIDE THE REASONABLE CONTROL OF Skedda. VENUE MAY HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS, BUT THE DURATION OF STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES, IF ANY, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE SHORTEST PERIOD PERMITTED BY LAW.
						</p>
						<h3>10. Third-Party Payment Providers</h3>
						<p>
							Skedda is not liable for any charge-related fees or penalties charged to the Venue by payment providers integrated with Skedda (such as Stripe). Such fees and penalties include, but are not limited to: payment-provider transaction fees, monthly service fees, account-keeping fees, credit-card chargebacks and fees resulting from other charge-dispute mechanisms exercised by Users.
						</p>
						<h3>11. Privacy</h3>
						<p>
							Skedda uses high ethical standards and respects User privacy. Skedda will duly and diligently safeguard and protect the privacy and confidentiality of Venue Data, including User personal information. Privacy Policy includes further details.
						</p>
						<h3>12. Limitation of Remedies and Damages</h3>
						<p>
							12.1. Consequential Damages Waiver. EXCEPT FOR EXCLUDED CLAIMS (DEFINED BELOW), NEITHER PARTY (NOR ITS SUPPLIERS) SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, LOST DATA, LOST PROFITS, FAILURE OF SECURITY MECHANISMS, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, RELIANCE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE.
						</p>
						<p>
							12.2. Liability Cap. SKEDDA’S AND ITS SUPPLIERS' ENTIRE LIABILITY TO VENUE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY VENUE TO SKEDDA DURING THE PRIOR TWELVE (12) MONTHS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.
						</p>
						<p>
							12.3. Excluded Claims. "Excluded Claims" means any claim arising (a) from Venue’s breach of Section 2.7 (General Restrictions); (b) under Section 3.3 (Venue Obligations) or 3.4 (Indemnification by Venue); or (c) from a party's breach of its obligations in Section 13 (Confidential Information) (but excluding claims arising from operation or non-operation of any Service).
						</p>
						<p>
							12.4. Nature of Claims and Failure of Essential Purpose. The parties agree that the waivers and limitations specified in this Section 12 apply regardless of the form of action, whether in contact, tort (including negligence), strict liability or otherwise and will survive and apply even if any limited remedy specified in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose.
						</p>
						<h3>13. Confidential Information</h3>
						<p>
							Each party (as "Receiving Party") agrees that all code, inventions, know-how, business, technical and financial information it obtains from the disclosing party ("Disclosing Party") constitute the confidential property of the Disclosing Party ("Confidential Information"), provided that it is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or should be reasonably known by the Receiving Party to be confidential or proprietary due to the nature of the information disclosed and the circumstances surrounding the disclosure. Any Skedda Technology, performance information relating to any Service, and the terms and conditions of this Agreement will be deemed Confidential Information of Skedda without any marking or further designation. Except as expressly authorized herein, the Receiving Party will (1) hold in confidence and not disclose any Confidential Information to third parties and (2) not use Confidential Information for any purpose other than fulfilling its obligations and exercising its rights under this Agreement. The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, agents, contractors and other representatives having a legitimate need to know (including, for Skedda, the subcontractors referenced in Section 14.8 (Subcontractors)), provided that such representatives are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective of the Disclosing Party than this Section 13 and that the Receiving Party remains responsible for compliance by any such representative with the terms of this Section 13. The Receiving Party's confidentiality obligations will not apply to information that the Receiving Party can document: (i) was rightfully in its possession or known to it prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (ii) is or has become public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving Party; (iii) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (iv) is independently developed by employees of the Receiving Party who had no access to such information. The Receiving Party may make disclosures to the extent required by law or court order, provided the Receiving Party notifies the Disclosing Party in advance and cooperates in any effort to obtain confidential treatment. The Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party the Disclosing Party will be entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law.
						</p>
						<h3>14. General Terms</h3>
						<p>
							14.1. Assignment. This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each party's permitted successors and assigns. Neither party may assign this Agreement without the advance written consent of the other party, except that either party may assign this Agreement in connection with a merger, reorganization, acquisition or other transfer of all or substantially all of such party's assets or voting securities. Any attempt to transfer or assign this Agreement except as expressly authorized under this Section 14.1 will be null and void.
						</p>
						<p>
							14.2. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement will be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in effect.
						</p>
						<p>
							14.3. Governing Law; Dispute Resolution.
						</p>
						<p style="margin-left: 10%">
							a) Direct Dispute Resolution. In the event of any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement arising from or relating to this Agreement, whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise, ("Dispute"), the parties shall first use their best efforts to resolve the Dispute. If a Dispute arises, the complaining party shall provide written notice to the other party in a document specifically entitled "Initial Notice of Dispute," specifically setting forth the precise nature of the dispute ("Initial Notice of Dispute"). If an Initial Notice of Dispute is being sent to Skedda it must be emailed to info@skedda.com and sent via mail to:
							<br>
							<br>Attn: Legal Department
							<br>Skedda Pty Ltd
							<br>PO Box 2375
							<br>Richmond, Victoria,3121
							<br>Australia
							<br>
							<br>Following receipt of the Initial Notice of Dispute, the parties shall consult and negotiate with each other in good faith and, recognizing their mutual interest, attempt to reach a just and equitable solution of the Dispute that is satisfactory to both parties ("Direct Dispute Resolution"). If the parties are unable to reach a resolution of the Dispute through Direct Dispute Resolution within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the Initial Notice of Dispute, then the Dispute shall subsequently be resolved by arbitration in accordance with Australian law.
						</p>	
						<p style="margin-left: 10%">
							b) Choice of Law and Jurisdiction. IF THE PARTIES ARE UNABLE TO REACH A RESOLUTION OF THE DISPUTE THROUGH Direct Dispute Resolution WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS OF THE RECEIPT OF THE Initial Notice of Dispute, VENUE AGREES TO SUBMIT AND CONSENT TO THE PERSONAL AND EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION IN, AND THE EXCLUSIVE VENUE OF, THE STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED WITHIN VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA. IN ANY DISPUTE, AUSTRALIAN LAW SHALL APPLY.
						</p>
						<p style="margin-left: 10%">
							c) Construction and Joinder. THIS AGREEMENT MUST BE CONSTRUED AS IF IT WAS JOINTLY WRITTEN BY BOTH PARTIES. BOTH VENUE AND SKEDDA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN THEIR RESPECTIVE INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS. NO ARBITRATION OR CLAIM UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE JOINED TO ANY OTHER ARBITRATION OR CLAIM, INCLUDING ANY ARBITRATION OR CLAIM INVOLVING ANY OTHER CURRENT OR FORMER USER OF THE SERVICES, AND NO CLASS ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS SHALL BE PERMITTED. IN THE EVENT OF ANY DISPUTE CONCERNING THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION, SUCH CLAIM MUST BE ADJUDICATED BY A COURT AND NOT BY AN ARBITRATOR.
						</p>
						<p style="margin-left: 10%">
							d) Injunctive Relief. Notwithstanding the above provisions, Skedda may apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.
						</p>
						<p>
							14.4. Notice. Any notice or communication required or permitted under this Agreement will be in writing to the parties at the addresses set forth in Section 14.3 or at such other address as may be given in writing by either party to the other in accordance with this Section and will be deemed to have been received by the addressee (i) if given by hand, immediately upon receipt; (ii) if given by overnight courier service, the first business day following dispatch or (iii) if given by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested, the second business day after such notice is deposited in the mail.
						</p>
						<p>
							14.5. Amendments; Waivers. Except as otherwise provided herein, no supplement, modification, or amendment of this Agreement will be binding, unless executed in writing by a duly authorized representative of each party to this Agreement. No waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or exercise rights under this Agreement, nor will any waiver be effective unless in a writing signed by a duly authorized representative on behalf of the party claimed to have waived. No provision of any purchase order or other business form employed by Venue will supersede the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and any such document relating to this Agreement will be for administrative purposes only and will have no legal effect.
						</p>
						<p>
							14.6. Entire Agreement. This Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements and communications relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. Venue acknowledges that the Services are online, subscription-based products, and that in order to provide improved customer experience Skedda may make changes to the Services, and Skedda will update the applicable Documentation accordingly.
						</p>
						<p>
							14.7. Force Majeure. Neither party will be liable to the other for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under this Agreement (except for a failure to pay fees) if the delay or failure is due to unforeseen events that occur after the signing of this Agreement and that are beyond the reasonable control of such party, such as a strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster, failure or diminishment of power or telecommunications or data networks or services, or refusal of a license by a government agency.
						</p>
						<p>
							14.8. Subcontractors. Skedda may use the services of subcontractors and permit them to exercise the rights granted to Skedda in order to provide the Services under this Agreement, provided that Skedda remains responsible for (i) compliance of any such subcontractor with the terms of this Agreement and (ii) for the overall performance of the Services as required under this Agreement.
						</p>
						<p>
							14.9. Subpoenas. Nothing in this Agreement prevents Skedda from disclosing Venue Data to the extent required by law, subpoenas, or court orders, but Skedda will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Venue where permitted to do so.
						</p>
						<p>
							14.10. Independent Contractors. The parties to this Agreement are independent contractors. There is no relationship of partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise or agency created hereby between the parties. Neither party will have the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other party's behalf without the other party's prior written consent.
						</p>
						<p>
							14.11. Export Control. In its use of the Services, Venue agrees to comply with all export and import laws and regulations of Australia and other applicable jurisdictions. Without limiting the foregoing, (i) Venue represents and warrants that it is not listed on any Australian government list of prohibited or restricted parties or located in (or a national of) a country that is subject to an Australian government embargo or that has been designated by the Australian government as a "terrorist supporting" country, and (ii) Venue will not (and will not permit any of its Users to) access or use the Services in violation of any Australian export embargo, prohibition or restriction.
						</p>
						<p>
							14.12. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original and all of which together will be considered one and the same agreement.
