                        <h2>Privacy Policy for Venue Users</h2>

						<p>
							At Skedda, we respect the privacy rights of our users and recognize the importance of protecting the Personal Data we collect about you. If you are a visitor to a Skedda Website or a customer of a Skedda Service, then except as expressly set forth below, this Privacy Policy applies to your use of such Website or Service. By visiting or using the Website or Services in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information in the described ways.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you are a visitor to or user of a third-party website or service that utilizes the Skedda Services ("Associated Venue"; a Skedda venue account for managing bookings hosted at e.g. thirdpartyvenue.skedda.com), then any information you submit to such Associated Venues (including via Skedda Services) is additionally collected under the privacy policy of the owners of such Associated Venues, and you should contact such owner with any related requests or inquiries you may have regarding their privacy policies.
						</p>
						<p>
							As used in this Privacy Policy, "Skedda", "us" and "we" refers to Skedda Pty Ltd and its affiliates. The "Websites" means Skedda’s websites (including www.skedda.com, any successor URLS, mobile or localized versions and related domains and subdomains), and the "Services" means Skedda’s proprietary software-as-a-service solution(s), including the Dashboard, Skedda application programming interfaces (APIs), Skedda Code and Skedda Apps.
						</p>
						<H3>What does this privacy policy cover?</H3>
						<p>
							This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Data") that we gather when you are accessing or using our Website or Services. Personal Data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person; an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. 
						</p>
						<p>
							This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.
						</p>
						<h3>Personal Data We Collect</h3>
						<b>
							Information Related to Your Interaction with Skedda and the Services
						</b>
						<i>
							Registration and Contact Information
						</i>
						<p>
							We collect information about you when you (a) register to use the Services and (b) otherwise provide contact information to us via email or through our Services. This information you provide may include your email address, first and last name, organization name or telephone number.
						</p>
						<i>Payment Information</i>
						When you purchase the Services or make a booking through an Associated Venue which has online payments enabled, we will also collect transaction information, which may include your credit card information, billing and mailing address, and other payment-related information ("Payment Information"). We describe below how Payment Information may be collected and processed under the main heading “Payment Information”.
						</p>
						<i>Technical, Usage and Location Information</i>
						<p>
							We automatically collect information on how you interact with the Services ("Log Data"), such as the IP address from which you access the Services, date and time, information about your browser, operating system and computer or device, pages viewed and items clicked. We may also collect location information, including location information automatically provided by your computer or device. We use cookies and similar technologies, some served by Third-Party Platforms, to collect some of this information. For more information, please see Skedda’s Cookie Policy.
						</p>
						<i>Third-party authentication identifiers</i>
						<p>
							We collect and store identifiers from third party services (such as Facebook, Google, Twitter, Microsoft and Apple) if you choose this option to authenticate yourself in Skedda (as opposed to a password-based login).
						</p>
						<b>User Data provided by Skedda Venue Administrators</b>
						<p>
							If you are an administrator of a Skedda venue account, you may submit Personal Data corresponding to natural persons other than yourself into the Services for booking, hosting and processing purposes (“User Data”). User Data may include, without limitation Personal Data such as names, email addresses, organization names and phone numbers of persons interacting with the venue account ("Users"). 
						</p>
						<p>
							We will only use, disclose and otherwise process User Data for the purposes set forth in your agreement with us for the provisioning of the Services (“Agreement”).
						</p>
						<h3>Retention</h3>
						<p>
							We collect and retain your Personal Data submitted in an identifiable format for the amount of time necessary to meet your request or fulfill our legal or regulatory obligations, unless it is in the legitimate interests of the Services and not prohibited by law to maintain the Personal Data for longer periods.  
						</p>
						<p>We specifically limit the retention period for certain types of information as follows:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Booking audit logs (concerning the users responsible for creating, updating, charging and deleting bookings): maximum of 90 days</li>
							<li>Booking information (concerning the storage of the actual booking information like scheduled time, holder, price, title and notes) made for your Associated Venues: maximum of seven years past the booking conclusion time (configurable by each Associated Venue)</li>
							<li>Server and analytics logs: maximum of 90 days</li>
							<li>Database backups: maximum of 35 days</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>How We Use the Personal Data We Collect</h3>
						<p>We use Personal Data in the following ways:</p>
						<ul>
						<li>
							To verify your identity using authentication mechanisms;
						</li>

						<li>
							To share your Personal Data with your Associated Venues (and also with other users of an Associated Venue if that Associated Venue chooses to allow it - please contact your Associated Venues if unsure);
						</li>
						<li>
							To manage your bookings at your Associated Venues;
						</li>
						<li>
							To communicate your booking interactions (creating bookings, cancelling bookings, modifying bookings) with your Associated Venues;
						</li>
						<li>
							To log audit information about your booking interactions (for auditing purposes of your Associated Venues);
						</li>
						<li>
							To provide, maintain and improve the Services and our other products and services, including to operate certain features and functionality of the Services (for example, by remembering your Personal Data so that you will not have to re-enter it during this or subsequent visits);
						</li>
						<li>
							To process your inquiries and otherwise deliver customer service;
						</li>
						<li>
							To process your payments, we share and use Payment Information as described under the heading “Payment Information”;
						</li>
						<li>
							To control unauthorized use or abuse of the Services and our other products and services, or otherwise detect, investigate or prevent activities that may violate our policies or be illegal;
						</li>
						<li>
							To analyze trends, administer or optimize the Services, monitor usage or traffic patterns (including to track users’ movements around the Services) and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole; and
						</li>
						<li>
							In the manner described to you at the time of collection or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.
						</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Lawful Basis for Processing of Personal Data</h3>
						<p>
							The lawful basis under which the Services process your Personal Data is contract. To use the Services, users are offered and must accept the terms and conditions documents that govern the use of the Services. 
						</p>
						<p>
							In some cases, your Associated Venue (or Associated Venues) will have executed a specific contract with Skedda governing the use of the Services for its set of users (typically to complement contracts between you and the Associated Venue). In such cases, the specific contract between the Associated Venue and Skedda forms the contractual lawful basis for the processing of your Personal Data in the Services. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Please contact us at info@skedda.com if you have any questions about the lawful basis for processing Personal Data.
						</p>
						<h3>Sharing Your Personal Data with Third Parties</h3>
						<p>
							We do not sell, trade, share or transfer your Personal Data to third parties except in the following limited circumstances:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								We may share your Personal Data with our listed third-party service providers to permit such parties to provide our basic/critical service functions. For example, we may provide Personal Data to our transactional email-sending provider for sending notification emails about booking transactions;
							</li>
							<li>
								We may share your Personal Data when we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce a Customer Agreement, including investigation of potential violations thereof, or (c) protect against imminent harm to our rights, property or safety, or that of our users or the public as required or permitted by law;
							</li>
							<li>
								We may share your Personal Data with third parties (including our service providers and government entities) to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud or security or technical issues;
							</li>
							<li>
								We may share your Payment Information to process your payments, as further described below under the main heading “Payment Information”;
							</li>
							<li>
								We may share and/or transfer your Personal Data if we become involved in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, or any form of sale of some or all of our assets; and
							</li>
							<li>
								We may share your Personal Data with a third party if we have your consent to do so.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							We may also share aggregated or anonymized information with third parties for other purposes. Such information does not identify you individually, but may include usage, viewing and technical information such as the types of Services our customers and users generally use, the configuration of their computers, and performance metrics related to the use of Services which we collected through our technology. If we are required under applicable law to treat such information as Personal Data, then we will only disclose it as described above. Otherwise we may disclose such information for any reason.
						</p>
						<h3>Payment Information</h3>
						<p>
							When you make a purchase on the Services or make a booking with one of your Associated Venues that requires online payment, any credit card information you provide as part of your Payment Information is collected and processed directly by the payment processor Stripe through their Stripe Elements service. We never receive nor store your full credit card information. Stripe commits to complying with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) and using industry standard security. Stripe may use your Payment Information in accordance with their own Privacy Policy here: https://stripe.com/us/privacy.
						</p>
						<h3>Other Access to or Disclosure of Your Information</h3>
						<p>
							The Services may also contain links to third party websites. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by us. Even if the third party is affiliated with us through a business partnership or otherwise, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third party. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with the privacy policies of such third parties to determine how they handle any information they separately collect from you. Please be aware that we do not warn you when you choose to click through to another website when using the Services.
						</p>
						The Websites contain features that enable you to make bookings with content that may be publicly viewable. You should be aware that any Personal Data you submit as part of those bookings can be read, collected, or used by other visitors to the Websites. You should contact your Associated Venues if you have any questions about the visibility of your Personal Data to the public.
						</p>
						<h3>Use of Intercom Services</h3>
						<p>
							We use third-party analytics services to help understand your usage of our services. In particular, we provide a limited amount of your information (such as sign-up date and some Personal Data like your email address) to Intercom, Inc. ("Intercom") and utilize Intercom to collect data for analytics purposes when you visit our website or use our product. As a data processor acting on our behalf, Intercom analyzes your use of our website and/or product and tracks our relationship by way of cookies and similar technologies so that we can improve our service to you. For more information on Intercom's use of cookies, please visit https://www.intercom.com/terms-and-policies#cookie-policy. We may also use Intercom as a medium for communications, either through email, or through messages within our product(s). As part of our service agreements, Intercom collects publicly available contact and social information related to you, such as your email address, gender, company, job title, photos, website URLs, social network handles and physical addresses, to enhance your user experience. For more information on the privacy practices of Intercom, please visit https://www.intercom.com/terms-and-policies#privacy. Intercom’s services are governed by Intercom’s terms of use which can be found at https://www.intercom.com/terms-and-policies#terms. If you would like to opt out of having this information collected by or submitted to Intercom, please contact us.
						</p>
						<h3>Ability for your Associated Venue to edit your Personal Data</h3>
						<p>
							A venue administrator of an Associated Venue is able to edit your name, contact number and organization if and only if that venue is your only Associated Venue. In this context it is understood that the venue is updating your Personal Data on your behalf. The venue administrator must have obtained your unambiguous consent to this privacy policy as well as the terms and conditions documents to do so. This consent must be presentable on request to Skedda and any competent supervising authorities. For security reasons, your Associated Venues are not able to update any other aspects of your Personal Data (email address, logins, passwords or credit card details).
						</p>
						<p>
							At all times, you can see the list of your Associated Venues by signing into your account and viewing the venue-selection control in the navigation bar.
						</p>
						<h3>Use of Services by Minors</h3>
						<p>
							The Services are not directed to individuals under the age of thirteen (13), and we request that they not provide Personal Data through the Services.
						</p>
						<h3>Your Rights, Controls and Choices</h3>
						<p>
							<b>Opt-Outs:</b> We may provide you with the opportunity to “opt-out” of having your Personal Data used for certain purposes when we ask for this information. If you decide to opt-out, we may not be able to provide certain features of the Services to you.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Communication Preferences:</b> If you no longer wish to receive our communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included on such communications or on the Services. Please note, however, that you may be unable to opt-out of certain service-related communications.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Blocking Cookies:</b> You can remove or block certain cookies using the settings in your browser but the Services may cease to function properly if you do so. For more information, please see the Skedda Cookie Policy.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals:</b> Your Web browser may have a “do not track” setting which, when enabled, causes your browser to send a do not track HTTP header file or “signal” to each site you visit. At present, the Services do not respond to this type of signal. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Skedda is an Australian entity and is directly bound by the Australian Privacy Act (1988, with 2014 and 2017 amendments). However, Skedda respects and fulfills its obligations under data-protection legislation in a number of other jurisdictions. Skedda's privacy policy and data-protection posture is specifically oriented on the EU GDPR and UK GDPR, typically considered the "gold standard" for such legislation worldwide. If you are a citizen of the European Economic Area (EEA), Switzerland or the UK, you benefit from certain rights granted by the EU GDPR and the UK GDPR, but subject to limitations therein. These rights include the right of access, rectification, restriction, opposition, erasure and portability, and the right not to be subjected to automated decision-making. Skedda will respect your rights under the EU GDPR and UK GDPR legislation. Skedda also respects other GDPR-similar legislation like the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) for citizens of associated jurisdictions. If you want to exercise those rights or find out more, please contact us at info@skedda.com.
						</p>
						<h3>Accessing, Changing and Deleting Your Personal Data</h3>
						<p>When you use the Services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your Personal Data upon your request and either provide you the means to correct this information if it is inaccurate or to delete such information at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. You may access, review, correct, update, change and delete your information at any time. To do so,sign in to your account, go to your profile, and make the desired changes (or contact us at info@skedda.com if you are not actively using the Services). The following information can be accessed and modified on your profile page:  
						<ul>
						<li>Name</li>

						<li>Password and login information</li>

						<li>Email address</li>

						<li>Organization name</li>

						<li>Telephone number</li>

						<li>Credit card information</li>
						</ul>
							<br>To delete this information completely, or to access and change other Personal Data stored about you, please contact us at info@skedda.com with your email address. We may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort (for instance, requests concerning Personal Data residing on backup tapes), jeopardize the privacy of others, would be extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required. We may also decline to process requests for Personal Data deletion if: 
						<ul>
						<li>
							we show it to be lawfully necessary to retain that information (e.g. for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information, for compliance with a legal obligation, for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, on the grounds of public interest in the area of public health, for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims); or
						</li>
						<li>
							we have not received permission from an administrator of each of your Associated Venues (for their compliance, auditing and legal reasons).
						</li>
						</ul>
						</p>
						<p>
							Your Personal Data may continue to exist in our backup databases, booking logs and server/analytics logs for a period of no greater than ninety (90) days after your Personal Data is deleted from our primary application database.
						</p>
						<p>
							In accordance with the Data-Processing Agreements into which Skedda has entered with its third-party processors, we will forward the request to erase your Personal Data from any relevant and connected third-party system.
						</p>
						<p>
							In any case where we provide Personal Data access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.
						</p>
						<p>
							Please note that if you cease using the Service or we terminate your access to the Service in accordance with the Agreement, you may no longer have the ability to access or update your Personal Data.
						</p>
						<p>
							We may retain your Personal Data as necessary to support the Services, comply with our legal obligations or resolve disputes. Note that content you supply through transactions (such as booking titles and notes) may remain on the Services even if you cease using the Services, if we delete your Personal Data, or we terminate your access to the Services.
						</p>
						<h3>Security</h3>
						<p>
							The security of your Personal Data is important to us. We maintain a variety of appropriate technical and organizational safeguards to protect your Personal Data. We limit access to Personal Data about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. Further, we have implemented reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards designed to protect Personal Data. When you enter sensitive information (such as your password), we encrypt that information in transit using industry-standard Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption technology. Refer to our document on data security for further information about the current security measures in place at Skedda.
